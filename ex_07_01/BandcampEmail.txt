Hi Ryan, 

Apologies, actually you’re dead right it’s redverspar@gmail.com.

Thanks for setting that up.

All fixed.

Thanks,
Red

Hi Ryan,

I’m sorry you’re mixing up tickets and what your saying doesn’t really make sense.

The payment problem is redversbailey account. Please keep that on the other thread.

The login problem is redversandmelissa and the address redverspar@gmail.com is my old now defunct PayPal email address. 

I was absolutely certain redversandmelissa was attached to redvers@redversbailey.com, are you sure it’s not? I gave up the domain a while ago now and it coincides with the last time I logged into redversandmelissa.

I bet you’re so confused right now haha sorry.

Thanks,
Red

Hey again Red, apologies that this hasn't been unkinked yet. I think I may have spotted the issue, and sorted things out. Please try resetting the password for "redverspar@gmail.com" one more time (sorry about the hassle!) and let me know if you don't have better luck this time around.

I spotted that you also wrote in about your payout - the good news is that you *did* change your PayPal email in time, however the purchase made on 4/4 is still pending, so we haven not yet been sent the funds by PayPal to in turn pay out to you. As soon as that happens (assuming something doesn't go wrong with the transaction) we'll pay those funds out to you within 24 hours.

Thanks for your patience,
Ryan
