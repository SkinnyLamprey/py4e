On a recent Women On the Go tour, we stopped here for lunch. We had a selection of their delicious soups, salads, unique pizzas, and crepes, followed by a light and delicious strawberry dessert. The entire meal was delicious, but the Club crepe was my favourite, and one of the best crepes I've ever had!
My only regret was that I was so full from this delicious meal that I didn't have room to try the delicious looking cinnamon buns! Oh well, another road trip out Carlyle-way?
